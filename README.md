#Course Overview
This course is divided into several modules, each covering different aspects of audio processing and deep learning with PyTorch. Here's a brief overview of what you can expect to learn in each module:

Introduction to PyTorch: Get started with PyTorch, learn about tensors, autograd, and basic operations.
Audio Data Representation: Understand how audio data is represented and manipulated in digital form. Learn about sampling, waveforms, and spectrograms.
Preprocessing Audio Data: Explore techniques for preprocessing audio data, including normalization, augmentation, and feature extraction.
Building Neural Networks for Audio: Dive into building neural network architectures for audio processing tasks such as classification, regression, and generation.
Training and Evaluating Models: Learn how to train and evaluate your audio models using PyTorch, including techniques for validation and testing.
Advanced Topics in Audio Processing: Explore advanced topics such as transfer learning, domain adaptation, and working with specialized audio datasets.
Each module consists of a combination of lectures, hands-on exercises, and coding assignments to reinforce your learning.
