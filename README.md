# Torch Audio Course

Welcome to the Torch Audio Course! This repository contains materials for the Torch Audio Course, which is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of audio processing using PyTorch and related libraries.

## Course Overview

This course is divided into several modules, each covering different aspects of audio processing and deep learning with PyTorch. Here's a brief overview of what you can expect to learn in each module:

1. **Introduction to PyTorch**: Get started with PyTorch, learn about tensors, autograd, and basic operations.
2. **Audio Data Representation**: Understand how audio data is represented and manipulated in digital form. Learn about sampling, waveforms, and spectrograms.
3. **Preprocessing Audio Data**: Explore techniques for preprocessing audio data, including normalization, augmentation, and feature extraction.
4. **Building Neural Networks for Audio**: Dive into building neural network architectures for audio processing tasks such as classification, regression, and generation.
5. **Training and Evaluating Models**: Learn how to train and evaluate your audio models using PyTorch, including techniques for validation and testing.
6. **Advanced Topics in Audio Processing**: Explore advanced topics such as transfer learning, domain adaptation, and working with specialized audio datasets.

Each module consists of a combination of lectures, hands-on exercises, and coding assignments to reinforce your learning.
